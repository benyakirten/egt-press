        desc: `Olive and Violet Bright have arrived on Cocoanut Palm Island for the opening of the Pacific Research Institute when Judith Pinckney shows them a beautiful, exotic flower before she departs for Hermosa. She explains that what she’s holding is a Water Orchid, a plant thought to have been extinct but is now growing again on the island. At the same time, there are reports of strange runoff in the waterways of Cocoanut Palm Island that’s harming the native wildlife. Olive and Violet take the flower to the Institute for examination. With the help of Lieutenant William Charlesson, the lead scientist at the Institute, they set about investigating the mystery and discover the tragic history that led to the suppression of the enchanting orchid. As they unravel the mystery, the Water Orchid begins to claim more of the island at the expense of everything else, and the young English turn to the Tahitian leaders and their priests for help. Together, they rally the people in a fight to save the island from impending ecological catastrophe.`,

        desc: `Jules Winters is certain of his destiny, to be a great man and inventor on par with geniuses like Edison or Carnegie. He may not have accomplished anything yet, but a terminal disease seems to be just the salvation he needs. It’s a call to arms with one solution, remake himself as an immortal, future-proof robot. His humanity is worth nothing compared to what he could accomplish without it. As a tireless machine, he could uplift the impoverished and make them valuable members of society. He’s so certain that it’s the best solution that there’s nothing that can dissuade him, not the incredible pain that comes with each step of his transformation, not the disregard he feels from his wife’s family, and certainly not the creeping feeling that no one will ever care about his masterwork.`,

A factory disassembles his memories as he investigates it. A house party ends with the disintegration of his body. But forget that. He only cares about one thing: that he exists. Well, he can’t say that with certainty. The cosmos has abandoned him and so has any way to know the truth, much less if such a concept exists. Inspired by the author’s experiences in a coma, follow John Albuquerque on the many paths of a mind in decline.`,
